/**
 * csv_parser Header File
 *
 * This object is used to parse text documents that are delimited by some
 * type of character. Some of the common ones use spaces, tabs, commas and semi-colons.
 *
 * This is a list of common characters encountered by this program
 *
 * This list was prepared from the data from http://www.asciitable.com
 *
 * @li DEC is how it would be represented in decimal form (base 10)
 * @li HEX is how it would be represented in hexadecimal format (base 16)
 *
 * @li	DEC	HEX		Character Name
 * @li	0	0x00	null
 * @li	9	0x09	horizontal tab
 * @li	10	0x0A	line feed, new line
 * @li	13	0x0D	carriage return
 * @li	27	0x1B	escape

/**
 * @class csv_parser
 *
 * The csv_parser object
 *
 * Used to parse text files to extract records and fields.
 *
 * We are making the following assumptions :
 *
 * @li The record terminator is only one character in length.
 * @li The field terminator is only one character in length.
 * @li The fields are enclosed by single characters, if any.
 *
 * @li The parser can handle documents where fields are always enclosed, not enclosed at all or optionally enclosed.
 * @li When fields are strictly all enclosed, there is an assumption that any enclosure characters within the field are escaped by placing a backslash in front of the enclosure character.
 *
 * The CSV files can be parsed in 3 modes.
 * @li (a) No enclosures
 * @li (b) Fields always enclosed.
 * @li (c) Fields optionally enclosed.
 *
 * For option (c) when the enclosure character is optional, if an enclosure character is spotted at either the beginning
 * or the end of the string, it is assumed that the field is enclosed.
 *
 * The csv_parser::init() method can accept a character array as the path to the CSV file.
 * Since it is overloaded, it can also accept a FILE pointer to a stream that is already open for reading.
 *
 * The set_enclosed_char() method accepts the field enclosure character as the first parameter and the enclosure mode as the second parameter which
 * controls how the text file is going to be parsed.
 *
 * @see csv_parser::set_enclosed_char()
 * @see enclosure_type_t
 *
 * @todo Add ability to parse files where fields/columns are terminated by strings instead of just one char.
 * @todo Add ability to set strings where lines start by. Currently lines do not have any starting char or string.
 * @todo Add ability to set strings where line end by. Currently lines can only end with a single char.
 * @todo Add ability to accept other escape characters besides the backslash character 0x5C.
 * @todo More support for improperly formatted CSV data files.
 *
